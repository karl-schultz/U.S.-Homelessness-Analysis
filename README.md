# Homelessness Among the U.S. States: an Exploration into Factors that may Influence Viability
### Description

This data analytics study seeks to investigate the varying conditions across the states of the U.S. that *these analysts hypothesize make homelessness a more viable proposition. The conditions studied include public policy, sheltering resources, and weather/climate. For public policy, the analysts explore and seek to prove the working hypothesis: states with more laws restricting the activities of homeless persons (e.g., laws banning camping in public, sleeping in public, living in vehicles, loitering, and pandhandling), will have lower rates of homelessness. On the point of shelters available for homeless persons, the analysts hyptothesize that states with more shelter resources will have higher rates of homelessness than those with fewer. Regarding the exploration of weather/climate, these analysts hypothesize that states with milder weather conditions (i.e., those without an average indicating freezing or sweltering periods) demonstrate a correlation with increased homelessness numbers.
